## 2. Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer

### Problem (`unicode1`): Understanding Unicode (1 point)

(a) What Unicode character does `chr(0)` return?
**Deliverable**: A one-sentence response.

NULL character

(b) How does this character's string representation (`__repr__()`) differ from its printed representation?
**Deliverable**: A one-sentence response.

repr shows '\x00' and print shows nothing. Because repr escapes non-printable control characters into visible form.

(c) What happens when this character occurs in text? It may be helpful to play around with the following in your Python interpreter and see if it matches your expectations:
```
>>> chr(0)
>>> print(chr(0))
>>> "this is a test" + chr(0) + "string"
>>> print("this is a test" + chr(0) + "string")
```
**Deliverable**: A one-sentence response.

NULL character is present in the string, but not printable. NULL character does not terminate the string like C.

### Problem (`unicode2`): Unicode Encodings (3 points)

(a) What are some reasons to prefer training our tokenizer on UTF-8 encoded bytes, rather than UTF-16 or UTF-32? It may be helpful to compare the output of these encodings for various input strings.
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

UTF-8 is most compact, so shorter context. No endianness and compatible with ASCII.

(b) Consider the following (incorrect) function, which is intended to decode a UTF-8 byte string into a Unicode string. Why is this function incorrect? Provide an example of an input byte string that yields incorrect results.
```python
def decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong(bytestring: bytes):
    return "".join([bytes([b]).decode("utf-8") for b in bytestring])
>>> decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong("hello".encode("utf-8"))
'hello'
```
**Deliverable**: An example input byte string for which `decode_utf8_bytes_to_str_wrong` produces incorrect output, with a one-sentence explanation of why the function is incorrect.

"こ". Given multi-byte UTF-8 unicode character, function is incorrect because it decodes one byte at a time.  

(c) Give a two-byte sequence that does not decode to any Unicode character(s).
**Deliverable**: An example, with a one-sentence explanation.

b'\xff\xff'. Not a legal byte.

b'\xe3\x81'. \xe3 indicates 3-byte sequence but missing third byte.

### Problem (`train_bpe_tinystories`): BPE Training on TinyStories (2 points)

(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the TinyStories dataset, using a maximum vocabulary size of 10,000. Make sure to add the TinyStories `<|endoftext|>` special token to the vocabulary. Serialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection. How much time and memory did training take? What is the longest token in the vocabulary? Does it make sense?
Resource requirements: ≤ 30 minutes (no GPUs), ≤ 30 GB RAM.
Hint: You should be able to get under 2 minutes for BPE training using `multiprocessing` during pre-tokenization and the following two facts: (a) The `<|endoftext|>` token delimits documents in the data files. (b) The `<|endoftext|>` token is handled as a special case before the BPE merges are applied.
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(b) Profile your code. What part of the tokenizer training process takes the most time?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

**Answer:**

### Problem (`train_bpe_expts_owt`): BPE Training on OpenWebText (2 points)

(a) Train a byte-level BPE tokenizer on the OpenWebText dataset, using a maximum vocabulary size of 32,000. Serialize the resulting vocabulary and merges to disk for further inspection. What is the longest token in the vocabulary? Does it make sense?
Resource requirements: ≤ 12 hours (no GPUs), ≤ 100 GB RAM.
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(b) Compare and contrast the tokenizer that you get training on TinyStories versus OpenWebText.
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

**Answer:**

---

### Problem (`tokenizer_experiments`): Experiments with tokenizers (4 points)

(a) Sample 10 documents from TinyStories and OpenWebText. Using your previously-trained TinyStories and OpenWebText tokenizers (10K and 32K vocabulary size, respectively), encode these sampled documents into integer IDs. What is each tokenizer's compression ratio (bytes/token)?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(b) What happens if you tokenize your OpenWebText sample with the TinyStories tokenizer? Compare the compression ratio and/or qualitatively describe what happens.
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(c) Estimate the throughput of your tokenizer (e.g., in bytes/second). How long would it take to tokenize the Pile dataset (825GB of text)?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(d) Using your TinyStories and OpenWebText tokenizers, encode the respective training and development datasets into a sequence of integer token IDs. We'll use this later to train our language model. We recommend serializing the token IDs as a NumPy array of datatype `uint16`. Why is `uint16` an appropriate choice?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

## 3. Transformer Language Model Architecture

### Problem (`transformer_accounting`): Transformer LM resource accounting (5 points)

(a) Consider a GPT-2 XL-sized model using our assignment architecture, which has the following configuration:
- `vocab_size`: 50,257
- `context_length`: 1,024
- `num_layers`: 48
- `d_model`: 1,600
- `num_heads`: 25
- `d_ff`: 4,288 (the nearest multiple of 64 to 8/3 × 1,600)

Suppose we constructed our model using this configuration. How many trainable parameters would our model have? Assuming each parameter is represented using single-precision floating point, how much memory is required to just load this model?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(b) Identify the matrix multiplies required to complete a forward pass of our GPT-2 XL-shaped model. How many FLOPs do these matrix multiplies require in total? Assume that our input sequence has `context_length` tokens.
**Deliverable**: A list of matrix multiplies (with descriptions), and the total number of FLOPs required.

(c) Based on your analysis above, which parts of the model require the most FLOPs?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

(d) Repeat your analysis with GPT-2 small (12 layers, 768 `d_model`, 12 heads), GPT-2 medium (24 layers, 1024 `d_model`, 16 heads), and GPT-2 large (36 layers, 1280 `d_model`, 20 heads). As the model size increases, which parts of the Transformer LM take up proportionally more or less of the total FLOPs?
**Deliverable**: For each model, provide a breakdown of model components and its associated FLOPs (as a proportion of the total FLOPs required for a forward pass). In addition, provide a one-to-two sentence description of how varying the model size changes the proportional FLOPs of each component.

(e) Take GPT-2 XL and increase the context length to 16,384. How does the total FLOPs for one forward pass change? How does the relative contribution of FLOPs of the model components change?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response.

## 4. Training a Transformer LM

### Problem (`learning_rate_tuning`): Tuning the learning rate (1 point)

As we will see, one of the hyperparameters that affects training the most is the learning rate. Let's see that in practice in our toy example. Run the SGD example above with three other values for the learning rate: 1e1, 1e2, and 1e3, for just 10 training iterations. What happens with the loss for each of these learning rates? Does it decay faster, slower, or does it diverge (i.e., increase over the course of training)?
**Deliverable**: A one-to-two sentence response with the behaviors you observed.

**Answer:**

### Problem (`adamw_accounting`): Resource accounting for training with AdamW (2 points)

Let us compute how much memory and compute running AdamW requires. Assume we are using float32 for every tensor.

(a) How much peak memory does running AdamW require? Decompose your answer based on the memory usage of the parameters, activations, gradients, and optimizer state. Express your answer in terms of the `batch_size` and the model hyperparameters (`vocab_size`, `context_length`, `num_layers`, `d_model`, `num_heads`). Assume `d_ff = 8/3 × d_model`.
For simplicity, when calculating memory usage of activations, consider only the following components:
- Transformer block
  - RMSNorm(s)
  - Multi-head self-attention sublayer: QKV projections, QKᵀ matrix multiply, softmax, weighted sum of values, output projection.
  - Position-wise feed-forward (SwiGLU): W1, W2, SiLU on the gate branch, element-wise product, W3
- final RMSNorm
- output embedding
- cross-entropy on logits

**Deliverable**: An algebraic expression for each of parameters, activations, gradients, and optimizer state, as well as the total.

(b) Instantiate your answer for a GPT-2 XL-shaped model to get an expression that only depends on the `batch_size`. What is the maximum batch size you can use and still fit within 80GB memory?
**Deliverable**: An expression that looks like a · batch_size + b for numerical values a, b, and a number representing the maximum batch size.

(c) How many FLOPs does running one step of AdamW take?
**Deliverable**: An algebraic expression, with a brief justification.

(d) Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) is defined as the ratio of observed throughput (tokens per second) relative to the hardware's theoretical peak FLOP throughput. An NVIDIA H100 GPU has a theoretical peak of 495 teraFLOP/s for "float32" (actually TensorFloat-32, which is really "bfloat19") operations. Assuming you are able to get 50% MFU, how long would it take to train a GPT-2 XL for 400K steps and a batch size of 1024 on a single H100? Following Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al., assume that the backward pass has twice the FLOPs of the forward pass.
**Deliverable**: The number of hours training would take, with a brief justification.

## 7. Experiments

### Problem (`experiment_log`): Experiment logging (3 points)

For your training and evaluation code, create experiment tracking infrastructure that allows you to track your experiments and loss curves with respect to gradient steps and wall-clock time.

### Problem (`learning_rate`): Tune the learning rate (2 B200 hrs) (3 points)

The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters to tune. Taking the base model you've trained, answer the following questions:

(a) Perform a hyperparameter sweep over the learning rates and report the final losses (or note divergence if the optimizer diverges).
**Deliverable**: Learning curves associated with multiple learning rates. Explain your hyperparameter search strategy.
**Deliverable**: A model with validation loss (per-token) on TinyStories of at most 1.45.

(b) Folk wisdom is that the best learning rate is "at the edge of stability." Investigate how the point at which learning rates diverge is related to your best learning rate.
**Deliverable**: Learning curves of increasing learning rate which include at least one divergent run and an analysis of how this relates to convergence rates.

**Answer:**

---

### Problem (`batch_size_experiment`): Batch size variations (1 B200 hr) (1 point)

Vary your batch size all the way from 1 to the GPU memory limit. Try at least a few batch sizes in between, including typical sizes like 64 and 128.
**Deliverable**: Learning curves for runs with different batch sizes. The learning rates should be optimized again if necessary.
**Deliverable**: A few sentences discussing your findings on batch sizes and their impacts on training.

**Answer:**

---

### Problem (`generate`): Generate text (1 point)

Using your decoder and your trained checkpoint, report the text generated by your model. You may need to manipulate decoder parameters (temperature, top-p, etc.) to get fluent outputs.
**Deliverable**: Text dump of at least 256 tokens of text (or until the first `<|endoftext|>` token), and a brief comment on the fluency of this output and at least two factors which affect how good or bad this output is.

**Answer:**

---

### Problem (`layer_norm_ablation`): Remove RMSNorm and train (0.5 B200 hrs) (1 point)

Remove all of the RMSNorms from your Transformer and train. What happens at the previous optimal learning rate? Can you get stability by using a lower learning rate?
**Deliverable**: A learning curve for when you remove RMSNorms and train, as well as a learning curve for the best learning rate.

**Answer:**

---

### Problem (`swiglu_ablation`): SwiGLU vs. SiLU (0.5 B200 hrs) (1 point)

Compare the performance of SwiGLU feed-forward networks versus feed-forward networks using SiLU activations but no gated linear unit (GLU): FFN_SiLU(x) = W2 SiLU(W1 x). In this ablation baseline, your FFN_SiLU implementation should instead set `d_ff = 4 × d_model`, to approximately match the parameter count of the default SwiGLU feed-forward network (which has three instead of two weight matrices).
**Deliverable**: A learning curve comparing the performance of SwiGLU and SiLU feed-forward networks, with approximately matched parameter counts.
**Deliverable**: A few sentences discussing your findings.
